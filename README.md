### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. student at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) and member of the [Data Systems Group](https://uwaterloo.ca/data-systems-group/). I research query processing, optimization, and storage techniques. I integrate research ideas in an in-memory prototype DBMS called [GraphflowDB](http://graphflow.io/).  

<!--**queryproc/queryproc** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
